# indoor-seedomation

 python-based indoor seedling starter bed temperature monitor and control.

 Consumes MQTT-published temperature sensor data. Implemented in my home network as a service on a Raspberry Pi.

Initially used `wemo` smart outlets. Also now have a version that uses `kasa` smart power strip.
